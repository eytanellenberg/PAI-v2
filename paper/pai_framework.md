# Performance & Availability Index (PAI) — Conceptual Framework

## Overview

Sport performance is widely recognized as a multifactorial phenomenon.
However, existing approaches rarely allow the observed performance of an individual athlete
to be attributed to distinct, actionable domains.

The Performance & Availability Index (PAI) is designed to address this gap
by decomposing observed performance into interpretable contributing domains
while accounting for both direct and indirect effects.

## Core principles

The PAI framework is based on four core principles:

1. **Multidimensionality**  
   Performance emerges from multiple interacting domains rather than a single latent factor.

2. **Attribution rather than aggregation**  
   The objective is not to summarize performance into a score,
   but to attribute observed performance to contributing domains.

3. **Indirect and mediated effects**  
   Not all determinants act directly on performance.
   Several factors influence performance through intermediate mechanisms
   such as availability, opportunity, or role constraints.

4. **Actionability**  
   Attribution outputs are structured to support practitioner-level decision-making.

## Attribution domains

Observed performance is decomposed across the following high-level domains:

- Availability and exposure
- Opportunity and role
- Execution and efficiency
- Physical and physiological state
- Psychological and cognitive readiness
- Contextual and environmental constraints

Domains are defined to be interpretable,
orthogonal at the decision level,
and comparable across sports.

## Structural vs. volatile effects

A key distinction within the PAI framework is made between:

- **Structural effects**  
  Persistent constraints related to health status, long-term role, or system-level decisions.

- **Volatile effects**  
  Transient limitations related to fatigue, short-term load, or contextual variability.

This distinction is critical to guide appropriate intervention strategies.

## Scope

The PAI framework is sport-agnostic
and can be applied to both individual and team sports.

In this work, the framework is illustrated using professional basketball case studies,
while relying exclusively on publicly available data sources.
