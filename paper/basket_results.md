# Basketball — Data and Results Overview

## Data sources

Basketball analyses rely exclusively on publicly available data sources,
including play-by-play events, shooting data, minutes played,
and lineup information.

These data allow reconstruction of:
- athlete exposure and opportunity
- contextual game conditions
- efficiency proxies adjusted for role

No proprietary tracking or private data are used.

## Athletes

Two professional basketball players are analyzed:

- **Player W**: a young athlete with evolving role and managed availability
- **Player D**: a central athlete with stable usage and high responsibility

---

## Performance outcomes

Rather than raw scoring metrics, performance outcomes reflect
context-adjusted offensive contribution at the possession level.

This outcome formulation enables separation between:
- opportunity-driven effects
- execution-related effects
- contextual amplification or limitation

---

## Attribution results (qualitative summary)

### Player W

Observed performance variability is primarily driven by:
- availability and exposure constraints
- evolving opportunity and role
- contextual decisions related to workload management

Execution efficiency contributes positively when exposure is sufficient,
but does not explain the majority of observed variability.

### Player D

Despite stable central involvement, performance variability is explained by:
- contextual and lineup-related constraints
- opportunity distribution across game states
- secondary efficiency fluctuations

Attribution highlights that performance limitations are not solely
attributable to individual execution.

## Practical implications

For Player W:
- performance interpretation should prioritize availability and exposure management

For Player D:
- contextual optimization may yield larger gains than individual-focused interventions
