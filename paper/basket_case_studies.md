# Basketball case studies

This work illustrates athlete-level performance attribution using two contrasted professional basketball profiles,
referred to as **Player W** and **Player D**.

No identifying information is included in the analytical pipeline.

## Player W — Performance under construction

Player W represents a young professional athlete whose performance trajectory is still under development.

Key characteristics:
- evolving role and responsibilities
- explicit workload and availability management
- progressive exposure to competitive demands

### Attribution challenge
Observed performance variations may reflect:
- constrained availability
- limited or evolving opportunities
- contextual decisions by the coaching staff

Rather than interpreting performance fluctuations as inefficiency,
the attribution framework aims to distinguish **structural constraints** from **performance execution**.

## Player D — Central performance under contextual constraints

Player D represents a high-usage, central athlete with a stable offensive role.

Key characteristics:
- consistent involvement in offensive actions
- high responsibility within team structure
- performance sensitive to contextual and lineup conditions

### Attribution challenge
Despite stable centrality, observed performance varies across competitive contexts.

The attribution framework aims to disentangle:
- individual execution
- contextual amplification or limitation
- opportunity-driven effects

## Rationale

Together, Players W and D illustrate two distinct but complementary attribution problems:

- performance construction under availability and role constraints
- performance variability under stable central responsibility

These case studies demonstrate how athlete-level attribution
supports decision-making beyond traditional performance metrics.
