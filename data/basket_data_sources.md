# Basketball — Data Sources

Basketball analyses rely exclusively on publicly available data sources.

## Core data components

### Play-by-play events
Used to reconstruct possessions, individual involvement, and game context.

### Shooting data
Used to derive efficiency proxies adjusted for opportunity.

### Minutes and lineups
Used to characterize exposure, role, and contextual dependency.

### Match context
Includes score differential, game phase, and location-related constraints.

## Rationale

These data sources reflect realistic information environments
available to performance analysts and coaching staff,
while allowing athlete-level attribution of observed performance.
